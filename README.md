# ospx-elitemod
Starting with xmod, a major overhaul was done to resemble OSP.  Unfortunately I did not use git initially and so it does not show all the changes that were done.  

I started this project as a fun learning experience (thanks to Murkey!) and I must say I have learned quite a bit.  However, looking back at it now, I should have done a lot of things 'properly'.  Please disregard any sloppy code you may encounter and/or don't hold it against me :)  

If I had more free time then I would definitely be spending it here.  If you can find use out of this then by all means use it and if you have any questions/comments/concerns then feel free to e-mail me at: nihilist314@outlook.com
