Main features added that are not in OSP:
 - unlag antilag
 - antiwarp
 - player HUD names during spectating
 - updated statistics - eventually will be web-based
 - global level server configuration (ET port)
 - server cvar restrictions (ET port)
 - various sv_fps fixes
 - allow teams feature for ET map porting (i.e. specific team can open doors with lock)
